Welcome!
I'm Zekun, a MSc student studying Digital Information Management at University College Dublin.

I'm interested in technologies for libraries, archives, and museums.
Programming languages I use include Python, Haskell, Ruby, and Rust.
And I'm always ready to learn new things for the right task.

Right now I'm writing my thesis on recommender systems for research data.
I'm also looking for a job, [contact me](mailto:zekun.hu@ucdconnect.ie) with your interesting opportunities!

### trivia
I'm a heavy tea drinker, Earl Grey and Sencha are my favorites.

I play videos games [The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://bindingofisaac.com/) and [Dota Underlords](https://underlords.com/).
