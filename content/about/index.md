Welcome!
I'm Zekun, a MSc student studying Digital Information Management at University College Dublin.

I'm interested in technologies for libraries, archives, and museums.
Programming languages I use include Python, Haskell, Ruby, and Rust.
And I'm always ready to learn new things for the right task.

Right now I'm writing my thesis on recommender systems for research data.
I'm also looking for a job, [email me](mailto:zekun.hu@ucdconnect.ie) with your interesting opportunities!

### contact
The discussion function is yet to be implemented for this site.
Besides [email](mailto:zekun.hu@ucdconnect.ie),
you can also reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=Timokratia&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

### trivia

I'm a heavy tea drinker; I drink at least four cups of tea each day.
[Earl Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea) and [Sencha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sencha) are my favorites.

I play videos games The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
([100% achivements completed, top 3%](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/250900/achievements/)),
and Dota Underlords ([7050 rank points](https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/2707145128901426684/)).
