Underlords (7050 rank points).\n\n\nthis site\nThis site is generated by Zola using Molly,\na blog theme based on Tufte CSS.\nThe contents on this site are CC BY licensed unless noted otherwise.\nLast updated on 05 Aug 2019.\n","id":"https://zekun.dev/about/","title":"about"},"https://zekun.dev/blog/molly-theme-basics/":{"body":"Introduction\nMolly is a Zola blog theme based on Tufte CSS.\nThe theme is a work in progress in its early stage of development.\nZola is a static site generator written in Rust;\ncheckout the documentation to get started.\n\n\nBasics\nInstallation\nTo use Molly theme with your Zola site,\nin your themes directory clone Molly theme's repogit clone https://github.com/timokratia/molly.git\nand in your config.toml file add theme = \"molly\".\nConfiguration\nIn your config.toml file's [extra] field,\nadd your GitHub profile (e.g. mine is github = \"https://github.com/timokratia\") for the code menu item to redirect to;\nalso add license information to the license field to display in the page footer;\nas well as your global banner quote and footer (see next section).\n\n\nIn your Markdown file\nAt the time of writing Molly theme has implemented sections, sidenotes, and margin notes from Tufte CSS.\nThey are achieved by using macros together with shortcodes.\nAdditionally, Molly theme uses epigraphs to display a pair of banner quote and footer on top of each page.\nSections\nTufte CSS recommends using \"section tags around each logical grouping of text and headings\".\nIn Molly theme, the content of your Markdown file is wrapped in a pair of section tags by default.\nTo add your first additional section with heading, use the following shortcode\n{{ section_begin(header=\"Your section header\") }}\nand following sections with\n{{ section_con(header=\"Another section header\") }}.\nSection headers are wrapped in &lt;h2&gt; tags.\nYou can add subsection headers using Markdown's ###.\nSidenotes and margin notes\nSidenotes and margin notes are easier to find than footnotes.\nTo add a numbered sidenote like thisThe body of the sample sidenote.,\nuse the following shortcode\n{% sidenote(unique_id=\"your-unique-id-for-sidenote\") %}Sidenote body{% end %}.\nSimilarly, an unnumbered margin note⊕Margin notes are unnumbered. can be created by\n{% marginnote(unique_id=\"your-unique-id-for-marginnote\") %}Margin note body{% end %}.\nPlease note that Tufte CSS requires you to manually assign a reference id to each side or margin note.\nIt's used to toggle the note on mobile.\nAlso there's a sneaky difference between section and sidenote/margin note's shortcode.\nThe shortcode to use sections starts and ends with {{ and }},\nwhile for sidenotes and margin notes it's {% and %}.\nThe reason is that Zola has different syntaxes for shortcodes with and without a body.\nThe section shortcode doesn't have a body because it only inserts &lt;section&gt; tags and a &lt;h2&gt; header.\nOn the other hand, sidenotes and margin notes require a note body in addition to a unique id.\nBanner quote and footer\nA pair of banner quote and footer is displayed on top of each page to serve as a brief introduction.\nThe global quote and footer you set in config.toml will be used as the default for every page.\nHowever, you can override them in individual page's front matter in the fields of\nbanner_quote and banner_footer under [extra].\n\n\nDesign considerations\nInspired by ayekat's website,\nMolly theme redirects the homepage of your site to the about page,\nand the blog page to your latest postHowever, this is achieved partially.\nIf you manually enter base_url/blog/ in the browser, you will still be redirected to the about page..\nI consider it straightforward, and it also reduces some coding.\nThe color palette used in Molly theme is generated from the base color of Tufte CSS, #fffff8, in ColorSpace.\nIt uses colors from the Matching Gradient palette:\n#d9ded2, #89a191, and #36675f.\n\n\nEpilogue\nContribution, questions, and suggestions are welcome!\nContact me in Molly theme's repo or tweet me directly.\nIf you're looking for other implementations of Tufte CSS,\ncheckout this awesome thread\nas well as both Gertjan van den Burg and ayekat's\nblog posts.\n","id":"https://zekun.dev/blog/molly-theme-basics/","title":"Molly theme
