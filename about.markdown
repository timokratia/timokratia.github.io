I enjoy server-side programming in Python and Haskell, and am ready to learn new technologies for the right task.

My research interests in information science include digital preservation, and information retrieval for research data.

I am also a heavy tea drinker and an avid [The Binding of Isaac](http://bindingofisaac.com/) player.
